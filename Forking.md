# Forking & Syncing a Repo

Directions for forking an assignment repo and keeping it properly synced.

## 1. Fork the Repo

Click the fork button in the upper right corner of the assignment repo.


## 2. Create a Local Clone of your Fork

Navigate to your newly forked repo, and clone the fork as you normally would by clicking on the green "Code" button and selecting your preferred method of cloning.

## 3. Configure Git to Sync your fork
1. Navigate to the location of your local clone of the fork
2. Type `git remote -v` You should see the current configured remote repository for your fork which will look something like this:
```
$ git remote -v
> origin  https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/YOUR_USERNAME/assignment2.git (fetch)
> origin  https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/YOUR_USERNAME/assignment2.git (push)
```
3. Type `$ git remote add upstream https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/CS4620-F2021/[assignment#].git` where `[assignment#]` is replaced with the number of the specific assignment. Do double check that the URL which follows `upstream` is the URL you would copy when cloning the **original** assignment repo.
4. To verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork, type `git remote -v` again. You should see the URL for your fork as `origin`, and the URL for the original repository as `upstream`. It will look something like this:
```
$ git remote -v
> origin    https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/YOUR_USERNAME/assignment2.git (fetch)
> origin    https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/YOUR_USERNAME/assignment2.git (push)
> upstream  https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/CS4620-F2021/assignment2.git (fetch)
> upstream  https://github.coecis.cornell.edu/CS4620-F2021/assignment2.git (push)
```

## 4. Syncing your Fork
If their are changes to the original repository, you will want to sync your fork with this repo by following these steps:
1. Navigate to the location of your local clone of the fork
2. Type `git fetch upstream` which will fetch the new commits from the upstream repository
3. Type `git checkout master` to ensure you are on the master branch of your local repo
4. Type `git merge upstream/master` to merge any changes from the original assignment repo into your local fork

## 5. Push your Changes (Optional)
Syncing your fork only updates your local copy of the repository. If you want to update your fork on GitHub make sure to push your changes!
