# Setting up your coding environment for Project 1

***Note: this text copied from this year's cs4620 assignment 1***

For this assignment we will ask you to code in TypeScript, using AniGraph and Three.js. This guide will give an overview of how to set these up.

First, some definitions:
- **JavaScript**: Think of this as the programming language of Internet browsers. If you want to write an application that runs in someone's browser, its logic will probably have to be turned into JavaScript at some point. JavaScript has some weirdness to it, and many of its quirks have something to do with unusual demands of running things in browsers... One thing to know about JavaScript is that it doesn't have types (e.g., `int`, `float`, `double`...) and this can make it tricky at times.  
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)**: Basically, JavaScript with Types... In practice, TypeScript code is "transpiled" into JavaScript before it runs; that means that JavaScript code is generated from the TypeScript you write, and that JavaScript is what actually runs in a browser. Check out [typescriptlang.org](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) for some useful documentation on TypeScript, and [this link](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) for a playground where you can quickly test out snippets of TypeScript code.
- **Node.js**: A Javascript interpreter. If we use a python analogy, Node would be analogous  to the numbered Python instance you use to run a python script. 
- **npm**: Short for "Node Package Manager", a JavaScript package manager that comes with Node. npm is basically the Node equivalent of `pip` for python---it allows users to install (and publish) packages from the npm registry using commands like `npm install xxx`.
- **nvm**: "Node Version Manager", which lets users switch between different versions of node and npm. It also allows for node to be easily installed, which is why we will install it first.
- **yarn**: A layer of fanciness that sits on top of npm, allowing for additional fanciness that is desireable. Here in CS4620, we are oh so fancy... But you already know...


Other stuff you should be aware of:
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/): the package we will be using to interact with WebGL. Three.js is *extremely* popular for browser-based graphics. I wouldn't say that it makes browser-based graphics simple, but it certainly makes it simple-*er*...
- AniGraph: An MVC system developed specially for this class. The code is in the [`./src/anigraph/`](./src/anigraph) directory. More on AniGraph later....

### Installing nvm

- Linux and mac users can follow the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script). Mac users can also install nvm using [homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/nvm), but BEWARE that some recent changes have made installing via homebrew a bit less straightforward. For more details on that, you can call `brew info nvm` and look at the text under `==>Caveats` that gets printed in your terminal.

- Windows users should follow the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/nodejs/setup-on-windows). Specifically, you will use the windows-nvm repository.

## Node and npm

As the name implies, in order to use npm, Node.js needs to be installed. For Mac and Linux users, run `nvm install node` in the terminal. By default, the OS should begin using the node version installed.

Windows users can run `nvm install latest` in the powershell as stated in the instructions linked for nvm installation. You need to then tell the powershell to use the version of node installed with `nvm use <version number>`. The powershell will tell you what version of node was installed.


#### Checking installation
Run `node -v` in the command prompt. If the version of node displays, Node.js has been succesfully installed.

#### Installing [`yarn`](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)
In your command line, once you have installed npm, install yarn by calling
```
npm install --global yarn
```
Now you are officially fancy.

# Running commands with [`yarn`](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)
While in the directory of a project (typically, whatever directory contains a `package.json` file) in command line, you will find the following commands useful.


|                Command            |   Purpose   |                   
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| `yarn install`   | Installs the project dependencies. Can also use `npm install package.json`
| `      yarn run start`   |Runs the webserver locally on your machine. It should typically default to http://localhost:3000/      |
|`yarn run build`         | Builds a static version of everything
|`yarn run test`         | Runs all the tests for the project.


# Installing WebStorm
Although you can use any IDE or editor you like for this class, we recommend WebStorm and will use it in our demos.
It's a commercial IDE but JetBrains provides a free educational license.

## Getting the license
Before installing Webstorm, head to the JetBrains website to get the [free educational license](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students). Follow the instructions to activate your license. You will also create an account with JetBrains.

Once the free educational license has been activated, install WebStorm. There are two ways to install WebStorm.

#### Option 1: Manually installing the IDE from the JetBrains website
Head to your account located [here](https://account.jetbrains.com/licenses). If the license has been activated correctly, there should be an item titled **JetBrains Product Pack for Students**. From here, click on **WebStorm** to download the installer.

#### Option 2: Installing WebStorm using JetBrains ToolBox
**JetBrains Toolbox** is an application that allows users to handle and update different tools and IDEs created by JetBrains. Some of you may already have this installed if you've used other IDEs created by JetBrains such as IntellIJ. If you don't have JetBrains ToolBox, you can install it [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/).

To install WebStorm, open JetBrains ToolBox and scroll down the list of available tools until you see the listing for WebStorm and press **install**.

## Activating WebStorm
Upon opening WebStorm for the first time, you will be asked to set up your UI environment preferences. It will also suggest packages to download but none are needed at this time.

Next, you will be prompted to activate WebStorm. Enter your username and password to activate WebStorm.


# Creating WebStorm configurations for a project
WebStorm allows you to create run/debug configurations. We will use the configurations as shortcuts to run the yarn commands from inside WebStorm. It's easiest to create these configurations after you have imported/created a project.

To create an yarn configuration, go to `Run -> Edit Configuration`. Press `+` button at the top left of the pop left menu. From here, select `npm` from the `Templates` dropdown menu. Next, follow the steps below.

1. Give the configuration an appropriate `name`.
2. Set `package.json` to the location of the **package.json** file of the project.
3. Set `Command` to the appropriate yarn command.
4. Set `Scripts` to the name of the script to run.
5. Set `Node Interpreter` to the location of **node.exe** on your system.
6. Set `project manager` to the file location of the **yarn** folder.

## Example Configurations
Below are a few examples of yarn configurations to get you started.

### yarn run start
|          Item            |   Value   |                   
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| `package.json`   | [path-to-cs4620]\assignment0\package.json
| `Command`  |run|
|`Scripts`       | start
|`Node interpreter`       | e.g. C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe or /usr/local/bin/node
|`Package manager`       | e.g. C:\Program Files\nodejs\node_modules\yarn or /usr/local/lib/node_modules/yarn
### yarn run build
|          Item            |   Value   |                   
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| `package.json`   | [path-to-cs4620]\assignment0\package.json
| `Command`  |run|
|`Scripts`       | build
|`Node interpreter`       | e.g. C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe or /usr/local/bin/node
|`Package manager`       | e.g. C:\Program Files\nodejs\node_modules\yarn or /usr/local/lib/node_modules/yarn

## Running a configuration
Run configurations from the configurations toolbar. This should be under the top toolbar. Look for the green play button icon to find the configurations toolbar options.

Once you have located the toolbar, select a configuration from the dropdown menu and select the appropriate action (run, debug, etc.)
If you meet any trouble opening the https://localhost:3000 after you run yarn run start, try run `yarn install` or `npm install package.json`. 

## Adding NodeJS to Path (Windows)
When you try to run a configuration, the terminal may say:
> '"node"' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

This means `node` is not part your Path in Windows so you will need to add it.

Open the Start Menu and search `environment` and click on **Edit the system environment variables**. Near the bottom, click **Environment Variables...**. In the table labeled **System variables**, select the row with the Variable name `Path` and click **Edit...**.

On the right, click **Browse** and then select the directory where NodeJS is installed. This will most likely be `C:\Program Files\nodejs\`. Click **OK** until you close all the windows. Restart WebStorm so that the IDE recognizes the new variable.

# Debugging with WebStorm
Debugging efficiently will be crucial when working on the projects. Luckily, WebStorm has a built in debugger that makes debugging much easier. The debugger will allow you to add breakpoints, step through your code, check variable values, etc.

To use the debugger, we will create another configuration.  Under `Run -> Edit Configurations`, select `JavaScript Debug` under `Templates`. Select `create configuration` and give the configuration an appropriate name. Set the `URL` to **http://localhost:3000/**. When you fill out the URL, the  box under `Remote URLs of local files` should populate. Save this configuration.

Select this configuration from the dropdown menu in the configurations toolbar. Next, press **debug** instead of **run**. This will open the debugger. From here, you can add breakpoints in your code and step through your code line by line. Make sure you have the code already running using yarn run start **before** you start the debugger.

# At the start of each assignment:
[Fork](./Forking.md) the repository so that you can easily merge any updates made to the assignment repository.

After cloning your forked repository for an assignment, remember to install the dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install package.json`. Things won't work until you do this!
