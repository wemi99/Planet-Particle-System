# Project 1: [Particles](https://youtu.be/kHgziac87-Y)

In this project, you will explore different types of particle systems. This being practicum, your work will be pretty open-ended, which is appropriate because there are a TON of things you can do with particle systems...

This document will provide you with an overview of AniGraph. For this project, we would like you to use AniGraph, even if it's only as a container for your own three.js code. For your final project you will have the option of forgoing the use of AniGraph in favor of some other scaffolding, but unless you already have experience in some other setting, it's likely that AniGraph will make your life much easier. 

## What is AniGraph?
AniGraph is package designed for CS4620/CS5620 in an effort to modernize assignments for the course. The guiding principles of this effort were:
- To make it easy for students to explore creative uses of graphics
- To make it easy for students to share their creative exploration with others through a browser.

To this end, AniGraph is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and uses [three.js](https://threejs.org/) for rendering in a browser. AniGraph applications can be built as a static website that is easy to serve from a personal webpage.

At its core, AniGraph is a combination of a scene graph, a model-view-controller framework, and tools expressing interactions with various graphical elements.

### Getting Started:
The best way to get started with AniGraph will be to look at the source code and provided docs (the latter of which we will be adding to over time and based on questions we receive).

In lecture on Monday October 5 I will be giving a walkthrough of AniGraph and the starter code. Before then, a good place to start would be the documentation in [src/docs/Customization.md](./src/docs/Customization.md).
